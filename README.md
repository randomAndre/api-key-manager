A secure and efficient API key management system that helps developers and teams easily manage API keys for various AI models.

## Preface
The API Key Manager aims to provide AI developers and enterprises with a one-stop solution for API key management. In today's diverse AI service environment, managing API keys from multiple providers is both cumbersome and poses security risks. This system helps users efficiently organize and utilize various service keys through secure encrypted storage, status monitoring, and convenient management features, reducing the risk of leakage and improving development efficiency. The system employs local storage technology, ensuring your sensitive key information is not uploaded to the cloud, further enhancing data security and privacy protection. Whether you are an individual developer or an enterprise user, the API Key Manager can meet your API key management needs. Of course, not only can it manage AI-related keys, but other related keys can also be uniformly managed using this manager.
